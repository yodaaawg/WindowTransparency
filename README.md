# Window Transparency Toggle Script

A customizable AutoHotkey (AHK) script that allows you to toggle and adjust the transparency of the active window in real-time. The script provides visual feedback via a tooltip showing the current transparency level and offers intuitive keyboard controls to manage window opacity.

## Controls

- **Toggle Transparency**:  
  `CTRL + ALT + Right Mouse Button (RMB)`  
  Activates or deactivates window transparency for the currently focused window. When enabled, a tooltip will show the current transparency level.

- **Decrease Transparency**:  
  `CTRL + ALT + Scroll Down`  
  Decreases the transparency by 10 units (down to 0, which is fully transparent).

- **Increase Transparency**:  
  `CTRL + ALT + Scroll Up`  
  Increases the transparency by 10 units (up to 255, which is fully opaque).
  
- **Toggle "Always on Top"**:  
  `CTRL + ALT + Middle Mouse Button (MMB)`  
  Fixes the current focused window above all other windows.

## How It Works

1. **Activation**:  
   Use `CTRL + ALT + Right Mouse Button (RMB)` anywhere inside the window you wish to modify. This enables transparency with an initial value of 220.
   
2. **Adjusting Transparency**:  
   Use `CTRL + ALT + Scroll Down` to make the window more transparent, or `CTRL + ALT + Scroll Up` to make it more opaque.
   
3. **Tooltip**:  
   When transparency is adjusted, a tooltip will appear near your mouse cursor showing the current transparency level. The tooltip disappears after 3 seconds.

4. **Always on Top**:  
   When window is focused, use `CTRL + ALT + Middle Mouse Button (MMB)` to fix that window always above other windows.

## Customization

- **Transparency Range**:  
  The transparency level starts at 220 (semi-transparent). You can adjust it from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (completely opaque).

- **Tooltip Duration**:  
  By default, the tooltip will disappear after 1 second. You can adjust this duration by modifying the `titleChangeDuration` variable in the script (in milliseconds).

## Requirements (ONLY THE .AHK FILE)
